{"name":"Angular Material","tagline":"Material Design implementation on Angular Dart.","body":"Angular Material [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akserg/angular.dart.material.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akserg/angular.dart.material)\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nBootstrap Material Design implementation for Angular Dart UI.\r\n\r\nInspired by *Federico Zivolo* implementation of [Bootstrap Material Design](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design).\r\n\r\nThis Bootstrap theme is an easy way to use the new [Material Design guidelines by Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in your Bootstrap 3 based application.\r\nJust include the theme, after the Bootstrap CSS and include the module in your Angular Dart project at the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design (Paper) style.\r\n\r\nCheck out [the Bootstrap elements at this link](http://akserg.github.io/angular.dart.material/web/index.html).\r\n                                  \r\n\r\n#### material-wfont.css or material.css?\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that `material-wfont.css` has the Google web fonts included.\r\n\r\n#### Use custom color as primary\r\n\r\nIs often asked how to change the primary color of this theme without edit the bower package directly.\r\n\r\nYou can do it by creating a less file in your project:\r\n\r\n    dependencies:\r\n      less_dart: \">=0.1.4 <0.2.0\"\r\n    transformers:\r\n      - less_dart:\r\n        entry_point: web/less/ripples.less\r\n        output: web/css/ripples.css\r\n    - less_dart:\r\n        entry_point: web/less/material-wfont.less\r\n        include_path: web/less\r\n        output: web/css/material-wfont.css\r\n    ...\r\n    // Override @primary color with one took from _colors.less\r\n    @primary: @deep-purple;\r\n\r\nThen, compiling this file, the entire theme will be compiled using the color chosen by you.\r\n\r\n### Buttons\r\n\r\nAdd `.btn-flat` to a button to make it flat, without shadows.\r\nAdd `.btn-raised` to a button to add a permanent shadow to it.\r\n\r\n### Inputs\r\n\r\nAdd `.floating-label` to an input field with a `placeholder` to transform the placeholder in a floating label.\r\nAdd `data-hint=\"some hint\"` to show an hint under the input when the user focus it.\r\n\r\nRemember to use the proper HTML markup to get radio and checkboxes styled correctly (choose between *radio* or *checkbox*):\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"radio/checkbox radio-primary\">\r\n        <label>\r\n            <input type=\"radio/checkbox\" checked>\r\n            Option one is this\r\n        </label>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n### Icons\r\n\r\nMaterial Design for Bootstrap includes 490 original Material Design icons!\r\nThese icons are extracted from the original Google sources and are licensed under the BSD license.\r\nThey are provided as an iconic and easy to use font.\r\n\r\nVariations are available for every icon, including the original Bootstrap icons.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to add a Material icon is:\r\n\r\n     <i class=\"icon icon-material-favorite\"></i>\r\n\r\n### Ripples\r\n\r\nThis is part of the Material Design for Bootstrap project and is a Dart script which creates the ripple effect when clicking on the specified elements.\r\n\r\nYou may want to set a custom color to the ripples of a specific element, to do so write:\r\n\r\n    <button class=\"btn btn-default\" data-ripple-color=\"#F0F0F0\">Custom ripple</button>\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nCurrently, Material Design for Bootstrap supports:\r\n\r\n- Google Chrome (tested v37+), \r\n- Mozilla Firefox (tested 30+), \r\n- Internet Explorer (tested 11+). \r\n \r\nMobile browsers are not currently tested but they may work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
